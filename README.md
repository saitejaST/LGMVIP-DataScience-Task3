Converting an image into a pencil sketch is a popular image processing technique that gives a hand-drawn, artistic appearance to digital images. This project utilizes Python and popular image processing libraries to automate the process and generate pencil sketch-like outputs.

The key steps involved in the conversion process are as follows:

Loading the input image.
Preprocessing the image to enhance edges and details.
Converting the preprocessed image into a grayscale representation.
Applying a pencil sketch filter to emphasize edges and textures.
Saving the resulting pencil sketch image.
The provided Python code automates these steps and provides a convenient way to generate pencil sketch effects.
